                    Pollution can take the form of any substance or energy. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can
                    be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution causes an
                    imbalance in the environment. This imbalance threatened the very survival of all forms of life. <br>

                                Ordinally the presence of alga is good for water bodies because algae produce oxygen by
                                photosynthesis. But this is true only when algae are not present in large amounts.
